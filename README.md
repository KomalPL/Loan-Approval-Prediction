📊 Loan Approval Prediction - End-to-End Machine Learning Project
📝 Project Overview
This project presents a full machine learning pipeline for predicting loan approval status based on applicant data. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and model export. It’s designed to simulate a real-world loan risk assessment system.

🚀 Objective
To build a predictive system that automatically determines whether a loan application should be approved or rejected, based on various applicant-related features, to help financial institutions reduce risk and improve decision-making.
